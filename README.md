# Code Refactor Challenge
In this challenge I refactored a website's HTML and CSS to fit with the goal of being more accessible while also making the code itself more readable. The CSS was shortened and combined where possible, and the HTML was changed to semantics. The code was generally cleaned up, comments were added, and a broken link was fixed. A preview of the updated page can be seen below.
